    'Imagine one day, your breathing became consistently labored and shallow. Months later you were finally diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. If that happened to you, you would want to know your prognosis. That’s where a troubling disease becomes frightening for the patient: outcomes can range from long-term stability to rapid deterioration, but doctors aren’t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum,Here is where our ML Model comes into play.',
